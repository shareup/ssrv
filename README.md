# ssrv is a javascript build server for local development and (eventually) production

(Pronounced ‚Äúserve.‚Äù)

`ssrv` uses `deno` and `esbuild` to server render and JIT compile `.tsx` with sensible conventions to make writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript websites and apps enjoyable again.

**_Under construction üöß not ready for production use._ Follow to be notified when the first release is published.**

## Features

* URL imports work both on the server and in the browser (esbuild plugin)
* Start rendering html by creating an `index.html.tsx` file in the root or any sub-directory
* `.ts` and `.tsx` files are compiled JIT when requested using `esbuild`
* Cache headers are set to sensible defaults. Files are compiled only once, then returned from cache from there.
* _More explaination to come..._

## Usage

To get up and running as quickly as possible, you can execute the server in your project directory:

```sh
$ deno run -A --watch=. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shareup/ssrv/main/server.ts
Watcher Process started.
Root file:///Users/username/path/to/project/
Listening http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

_Anytime any file changes the entire server will restart._

_Use `^C` to exit._

### `deno.json` usage

If you have a `deno.json` file for your project, you need to tell deno explicitly where it is when using the remote server file:

```sh
$ deno run -c ./deno.json -A --watch=. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shareup/ssrv/main/server.ts
...
```

Or if you want to customize the configuration you can write your own server.ts:

```ts server.ts
import { configure, serve } from 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shareup/ssrv/main/mod.ts'

const config = await configure({
  port: 5678,
  // ... see config/types.ts
})

const server = await serve(config)

await server.listener

Deno.exit(0)
```

Then you can execute your server file like:

```sh
$ deno run -A --watch=. server.ts
```

_This will automatically use your local `deno.json` file if you have one._

_Use `^C` to exit._
